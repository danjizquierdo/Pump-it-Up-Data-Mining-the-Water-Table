# Week 9 Project  
[`Pump-it-Up-Data-Mining-the-Water-Table`]

# Goal
The goal of this project is to predict which pumps are functional ( or need some repairs), which are not funtional. KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest are applied in this project. According to accuracy_score and F1_score, Random Forest model is selected as the final model. 

# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
In order to obtian the best prediction, I removed some columns which contian missing data more than 20%. Then remove rows which contians missing values.
