# Week 9 Project - `Pump-it-Up-Data-Mining-the-Water-Table`

# Goal
## The goal of this project is to predict which pumps are functional ( or need some repairs), which are not funtional.
KNN,Ddecision Tree and Random Forest are applied in this project.

# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
## In order to obtian the best prediction, I removed some columns which contian missing data more than 20% .
## Then remove rows which contians missing values.

# Distribution of Target and Inputs 




# Feature Selection




# Train Test Split

# Oversampling
# Data Standardization (StandardScaler)
#KNN
#Random Forest
# Decision Tree

# Conclusion
